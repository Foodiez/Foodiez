You can place any vegetarian or non-vegetarian toppings of your choice in this pizza and expect it to get cooked correctly.

A brick oven pizza gets cooked by the high temperature achieved by employing burning wood, so make sure the woods you’re using are properly lit and of good quality for maximum flavors.
